For transplantations, a four-stage process follows: planning, extraction of hair follicles, precise implantation, and aftercare. Our Dion App supports you throughout the entire process with personalized instructions and reminders.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the recovery period?",
        "answer": "Most patients can return to their normal activities after 1-2 days. Redness and swelling usually subside within 5-10 days. Complete healing takes about 10-14 days, with the healing time for beard and eyebrow transplantations tending to be shorter than for scalp hair transplantations.",
        "category": "general"
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I see the first results?",
        "answer": "For all treatments, the first new hairs begin to grow after about 3-4 months. The final results are visible after 12-18 months for hair transplantations, after 6-9 months for eyebrow transplantations, and after about 12 months for beard transplantations.",
        "category": "general"
      },
      {
        "question": "How much do the treatments cost?",
        "answer": "Costs vary depending on the type of treatment and extent. For transplantations, the price is mainly based on the number of grafts needed: hair transplantations (1,500-5,000+ grafts), beard transplantations (500-3,000 grafts), and eyebrow transplantations (100-400 grafts). For an accurate cost estimate, we recommend a free consultation.",
        "category": "general"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the treatment painful?",
        "answer": "All our treatments are designed to be as pain-free as possible. Transplantations are performed under local anesthesia, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. With our optional DPI technology, even the anesthesia phase is almost pain-free. After the procedure, mild discomfort may occur, but this can be well controlled with pain medication.",
        "category": "general"
      },
      {
        "question": "What hair transplantation techniques do you offer?",
        "answer": "We offer state-of-the-art techniques such as Sapphire-FUE and DHI. The Sapphire-FUE technique uses special sapphire blades that enable more precise incisions. The DHI technique allows direct implantation without prior channel creation. In a personal consultation, we recommend the optimal method for you.",
        "category": "hair"
      },
      {
        "question": "For which hair loss patterns is a hair transplantation suitable?",
        "answer": "A hair transplantation is suitable for various hair loss patterns, from slight recession of the hairline to extensive hair loss. We successfully treat receding hairlines, vertex thinning, and diffuse hair loss in men and women. The number of grafts needed and sessions depends on the extent of hair loss.",

        "question": "How natural does the result of a hair transplantation look?",

      {
        "question": "Can I get a full beard if I have little beard growth?",
        "answer": "Yes, a beard transplantation is also suitable for men with little or no natural beard growth. The hair follicles are taken from suitable donor areas on the head and transplanted into the desired areas of the face. The result is a natural-looking beard that can be designed according to your wishes.",

      {
        "question": "What beard styles can be achieved with a transplantation?",

      {
        "question": "Do I need to trim my transplanted eyebrows regularly?",

        "category": "eyebrows"
      },
      {
        "question": "How are the eyebrows designed during a transplantation?",
        "answer": "During an eyebrow transplantation, we design the shape individually to match your face. We consider your facial shape, personal style, and natural eyebrow shapes. Special attention is paid to the correct angle and direction of the hair follicles to achieve a natural growth pattern.",
        "category": "eyebrows"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can eyebrows be restored after microblading?",
        "answer": "Yes, eyebrows can be restored through transplantation even after microblading. We take into account the condition of the skin and any existing pigmentation. The transplanted hairs grow naturally and, unlike microblading, offer a permanent solution without regular touch-ups.",
        "category": "eyebrows"

      {
        "question": "What non-surgical therapies do you offer for hair loss?",

        "category": "therapy"
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the results of a hair loss therapy permanent?",
        "answer": "The results can be permanent if the therapy is consistently continued. For hormone-related hair loss, maintenance therapy is often necessary to secure the results in the long term. We advise you in detail about the necessary measures to maintain your results.",

      {

It is ideal for patients seeking a non-surgical solution or wanting to optimally support their hair transplantation. It is also a good option for younger patients for whom a transplantation is not yet recommended.",
