        "answer": "Yes, a beard transplantation is also possible for men with little or no natural beard growth. In this case, the hair follicles are taken from suitable donor areas on the head and transplanted into the desired areas of the face. The result is a natural-looking beard that can be designed according to your wishes.",

At Dion Hair Clinic, you benefit from the highest medical expertise, state-of-the-art technology, and comprehensive aftercare without language barriers.

        "category": "general"
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the procedure take?",
        "answer": "The duration of the procedure depends on the number of grafts to be transplanted. Typically, a beard transplantation takes between 3 and 6 hours. For larger transplantations, the procedure may be divided over two days to achieve optimal results and reduce the strain on the patient.",
        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "Which method is best suited for me?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is the procedure painful?",
        "answer": "The beard transplantation is performed under local anesthesia, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. After the procedure, mild discomfort may occur, but this can be well controlled with pain medication.",
        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I prepare for the procedure?",
        "answer": "For preparation, we recommend avoiding blood-thinning medications (after consulting with your doctor), alcohol, and nicotine for 10 days before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, you should wear comfortable clothing. We will advise you in detail about all further preparatory measures in a personal consultation.",

      {
        "question": "How long is the recovery period?",

      {
        "question": "What does the aftercare look like?",
        "answer": "Proper aftercare is crucial for the success of the treatment. In the first days after the procedure, we will provide you with detailed instructions for caring for the treated areas. This includes special cleaning products, sleeping positions, and behavioral rules.

      {
        "question": "When can I shave or trim my beard again?",
        "answer": "After a beard transplantation, you should avoid shaving for at least 14 days to not compromise the healing of the transplanted follicles. After about 3 weeks, you can carefully start trimming your beard with an electric hair clipper (not with a razor). After 4-6 weeks, full shaving is usually possible again, but we recommend doing this carefully and with an electric razor initially.",
        "category": "recovery"
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I see the first results?",
        "answer": "The first new beard hairs begin to grow after about 3-4 months. The final result is visible after 12-18 months, when the transplanted hairs have fully grown and reached their natural density.",
        "category": "results"
      },
      {
        "question": "How realistic are the results?",
        "answer": "Modern beard transplantation techniques now enable very natural-looking results. The transplanted hairs grow like your own beard hairs and can be cut, trimmed, and styled normally. Crucial for a natural result are the experience of the treating team, the correct placement of the hair follicles, and consideration of your individual facial features and natural beard growth pattern.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the result of a beard transplantation last?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I color my transplanted beard?",
        "answer": "Yes, after complete healing (about 4-6 weeks after the procedure), you can treat your transplanted beard like your natural beard. You can color, trim, and style it. The transplanted hairs behave like your own hair and grow in a natural cycle.",

      {
        "question": "How much does a beard transplantation cost?",

      {
        "question": "Are the costs of a beard transplantation covered by health insurance?",
