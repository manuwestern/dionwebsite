    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Which method is best suited for me?",
        "answer": "The best method depends on various factors, such as the extent of hair loss, the quality of the donor hair, and your personal preferences. In a personal consultation, we can determine the optimal method for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the recovery phase?",
        "answer": "Most patients can return to their normal activities after 1-2 days. Redness and swelling usually subside within 7-10 days. Complete healing of the scalp takes about 2 weeks."
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I see the first results?",
        "answer": "The first new hairs begin to grow after about 3-4 months. The final result is visible after 12-18 months when the transplanted hairs have fully grown and reached their natural density."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the procedure painful?",
        "answer": "The hair transplantation is performed under local anesthesia, so you will not feel any pain during the procedure. After the procedure, slight discomfort may occur, which can be well controlled with pain medication."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does a hair transplantation cost?",
        "answer": "The cost of a hair transplantation depends on various factors, particularly the number of grafts to be transplanted and the chosen method. At Dion Hair Clinic, we offer transparent pricing models and various financing options. In a personal consultation, we will create an individual offer for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "At what age can I have a hair transplantation?",
        "answer": "Generally, we recommend having a hair transplantation only from the age of 25, as the hair loss pattern can still change until then. In some cases, however, treatment may also be advisable for younger patients. The crucial factor is that the hair loss is stable and a clear pattern is recognizable."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there risks or side effects?",
        "answer": "As with any medical procedure, there are certain risks associated with hair transplantation. However, these are minimal when performed properly. Possible side effects include temporary swelling, redness, slight bruising, or, in rare cases, infections. Our experienced team minimizes these risks through the highest hygiene standards and careful aftercare."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the result of a hair transplantation last?",
        "answer": "The transplanted hairs are permanent because they are taken from areas that are not genetically susceptible to hair loss. However, the natural aging process or progressive hair loss in other areas may change the overall appearance over time. Complementary treatments such as PRP or mesotherapy can help strengthen and maintain the non-transplanted hair."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does a treatment in Germany differ from offers abroad?",
        "answer": "In Germany, hair transplantations are subject to strict medical standards and quality controls. At Dion Hair Clinic, you benefit from the highest medical expertise, state-of-the-art technology, and comprehensive aftercare without language barriers. Unlike some foreign offers, our treatments are performed exclusively by experienced specialists, not trained assistants."
      },
      {
        "question": "How realistic are the results?",
        "answer": "Modern hair transplantation techniques now enable very natural-looking results. The transplanted hair grows like your own hair and can be cut, colored, and styled normally. The experience of the treatment team, the correct placement of the hair follicles, and consideration of your individual facial features and natural hair growth pattern are crucial for a natural result."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I prepare for the procedure?",
        "answer": "For preparation, we recommend avoiding blood-thinning medications (after consulting with your doctor), alcohol, and nicotine for 10 days before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, you should wear comfortable clothing that does not need to be pulled over your head. We will advise you in detail about all further preparatory measures in a personal consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the aftercare look like?",
        "answer": "Proper aftercare is crucial for the success of the treatment. In the first days after the procedure, you will receive detailed instructions from us on how to care for the treated areas. This includes special shampoos, sleeping positions, and behavioral rules. Regular check-up appointments at our clinic ensure that the healing process proceeds optimally and that your questions are answered at any time."
