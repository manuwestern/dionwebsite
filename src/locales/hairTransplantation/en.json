        "question": "From what age can I have a hair transplantation?",
        "answer": "Generally, we recommend having a hair transplantation from the age of 25, as the hair loss pattern can still change until then. In some cases, however, treatment may also be advisable for younger patients. The crucial factor is that the hair loss is stable and a clear pattern is recognizable.",

      {
        "question": "Are there risks or side effects?",

Possible side effects include temporary swelling, redness, mild bruising, or, in rare cases, infections. Our experienced team minimizes these risks through the highest hygiene standards and careful aftercare.",

At Dion Hair Clinic, you benefit from the highest medical expertise, state-of-the-art technology, and comprehensive aftercare without language barriers.

        "category": "general"
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the procedure take?",
        "answer": "The duration of the procedure depends on the number of grafts to be transplanted. Typically, a hair transplantation takes between 4 and 8 hours. For larger transplantations, the procedure may be divided over two days to achieve optimal results and reduce the strain on the patient.",
        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "Which method is best suited for me?",
        "answer": "The best method depends on various factors, such as the extent of hair loss, the quality of donor hair, and your personal preferences. In a personal consultation, we can determine the optimal method for you.",
        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the procedure painful?",
        "answer": "The hair transplantation is performed under local anesthesia, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. After the procedure, mild discomfort may occur, but this can be well controlled with pain medication.",
        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I prepare for the procedure?",
        "answer": "For preparation, we recommend avoiding blood-thinning medications (after consulting with your doctor), alcohol, and nicotine for 10 days before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, you should wear comfortable clothing that doesn't need to be pulled over your head. We will advise you in detail about all further preparatory measures in a personal consultation.",

      {
        "question": "How long is the recovery period?",
        "answer": "Most patients can return to their normal activities after 1-2 days. Redness and swelling usually subside within 7-10 days. Complete healing of the scalp takes about 2 weeks.",
        "category": "recovery"
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the aftercare look like?",
        "answer": "Proper aftercare is crucial for the success of the treatment. In the first days after the procedure, we will provide you with detailed instructions for caring for the treated areas. This includes special shampoos, sleeping positions, and behavioral rules. Regular check-up appointments at our clinic ensure that the healing process proceeds optimally and your questions are answered at any time.",

      {
        "question": "When can I exercise again after a hair transplantation?",
        "answer": "You can resume light physical activities after one week. However, you should wait 3-4 weeks before engaging in intense sports and strength training to avoid compromising the healing of the transplantation sites. Swimming and sauna visits should also be avoided for at least 3 weeks to prevent infections.",
        "category": "recovery"
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I see the first results?",
        "answer": "The first new hairs begin to grow after about 3-4 months. The final result is visible after 12-18 months, when the transplanted hairs have fully grown and reached their natural density.",
        "category": "results"
      },
      {
        "question": "How realistic are the results?",
        "answer": "Modern hair transplantation techniques now enable very natural-looking results. The transplanted hairs grow like your own hair and can be cut, colored, and styled normally. Crucial for a natural result are the experience of the treating team, the correct placement of the hair follicles, and consideration of your individual facial features and natural hair growth pattern.",

      {
        "question": "How long does the result of a hair transplantation last?",
        "answer": "The transplanted hairs are permanent, as they are taken from areas that are not genetically susceptible to hair loss. However, the natural aging process or progressive hair loss in other areas may change the overall appearance over time. Complementary treatments such as Mesotherapy can help strengthen and maintain the non-transplanted hairs.",
        "category": "results"

      {
        "question": "Can I color or cut my transplanted hair?",
        "answer": "Yes, after complete healing (about 3-4 weeks after the procedure), you can treat your transplanted hair like your natural hair. You can cut, color, and style it. The transplanted hair behaves like your own hair and grows in a natural cycle.",

      {
        "question": "Are the costs of a hair transplantation covered by health insurance?",
