        "question": "Can I get an eyebrow transplantation if I have no eyebrows at all?",

In this case, the hair follicles are taken from suitable donor areas on the head and transplanted into the eyebrow area. Our specialists can design a natural-looking eyebrow shape that suits your facial features, even if there is no template from existing eyebrows.",

      {
        "question": "Which method is best suited for me?",

        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the procedure painful?",
        "answer": "The eyebrow transplantation is performed under local anesthesia, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. After the procedure, mild discomfort may occur, but this can be well controlled with pain medication.",
        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I prepare for the procedure?",
        "answer": "For preparation, we recommend avoiding blood-thinning medications (after consulting with your doctor), alcohol, and nicotine for 10 days before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, you should not wear makeup in the eye area. We will advise you in detail about all further preparatory measures in a personal consultation.",
        "category": "procedure"
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the procedure take?",
        "answer": "The duration of the procedure depends on the number of grafts to be transplanted. Typically, an eyebrow transplantation takes between 2 and 4 hours. The entire process, including preparation and aftercare, takes about half a day.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the recovery period?",

Regular check-up appointments at our clinic ensure that the healing process proceeds optimally and your questions are answered at any time.",

      },
      {
        "question": "When can I use makeup in the eyebrow area again?",
        "answer": "After an eyebrow transplantation, you should avoid using makeup in the eyebrow area for at least 10-14 days to not compromise the healing of the transplanted follicles. After this time, you can carefully start using makeup again, but should avoid aggressive products and strong rubbing. After about 3-4 weeks, the use of makeup is usually possible without restrictions.",
        "category": "recovery"
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I see the first results?",

      {
        "question": "How realistic are the results?",
        "answer": "Modern eyebrow transplantation techniques now enable very natural-looking results. The transplanted hairs grow like your own hairs and can be trimmed and styled normally. Crucial for a natural result are the experience of the treating team, the correct placement of the hair follicles, and consideration of your individual facial features and natural growth pattern.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the result of an eyebrow transplantation last?",

        "category": "results"
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to trim my eyebrows regularly after the transplantation?",
        "answer": "Yes, since the transplanted hairs usually come from the head, they grow faster than natural eyebrow hairs and need to be trimmed regularly. We will show you how to care for and maintain the shape of your new eyebrows.",
        "category": "results"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change the shape of my transplanted eyebrows later?",
        "answer": "After an eyebrow transplantation, you can adjust the shape of your eyebrows through regular trimming and styling. However, major changes to the basic shape are limited, as the growth direction and placement of the hair follicles are determined during the transplantation. Therefore, it is important to discuss the desired shape in detail before the procedure. If needed, adjustments can be made in a second session.",

      },
      {
        "question": "How much does an eyebrow transplantation cost?",

At Dion Hair Clinic, we offer transparent pricing models and various financing options. In a personal consultation, we will create an individual offer for you.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are the costs of an eyebrow transplantation covered by health insurance?",
        "answer": "Generally, the costs for an eyebrow transplantation are not covered by statutory health insurance, as it is considered an aesthetic procedure. Some private health insurance plans may offer partial coverage, especially if the hair loss was caused by injuries, burns, or certain diseases. We are happy to advise you on the various financing options we offer.",
